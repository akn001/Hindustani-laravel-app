I have Used MYSQL for database..


Create a simple but object-oriented Laravel app, called "Hindustani" having the following features:
The app will have the following pages:

Index page, listing people with details like, Name, Aadhaar, Bdate, etc. with just "Show detail" link, which opens Details page. It should have pagination.
Detail page, that shows the following information of the person
 - Name
 - Aadhar #
 - Birth date
 - Father (linked to father's Detail page)
 - Mother (linked to mother's Detail page)
 - Children (linked to child's Detail page)
 - Back button or link to go back to Index page
Use MySQL or PostgreSQL as a database.
